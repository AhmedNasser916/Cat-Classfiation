# Cats and Dogs classification using CNN

The goal for task is designing and building classifiers that would effectively classify images of cats and dogs.
The main goal of this task is to develop a system that can identify images of cats and dogs. The input for this task is images of dogs or cats from training dataset, while the output is the classification accuracy on test dataset. The Dogs vs Cats dataset can be downloaded from the Kaggle website. The dataset contains a set of images of cats and dogs. Our main aim here is for the model to learn various distinctive features of cat and dog. Once the training of the model is done it will be able to differentiate images of cat and dog.

------

The dataset we downloaded from the Kaggle website. In total, there are 5363 images, 66% for the training set, and 33% for the test set. In the training set, 5,363 images of dogs, while the test set has 2,644 images of dogs, and the rest are cats. All images are saved in a special folder structure, making it easy for Keras to understand and differentiate the animal category of each image, as shown in Figure 1.
